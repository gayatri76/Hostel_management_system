The Hostel Management System is developed for advancing the activities of the hostel.
The main benefit of the software is to remove manual system. Since most hostels are
being run by only one hostel manager. The number of students in a room, the students
who owe to the hostel etc are saved on papers or sometimes receipts. If these documents
should go missing or stolen, one would never be able to know .The employees might not
know the number of students in a room or know if a room is full or not. This project
will be great relief to the employees. This will help to carry out the activities of Hostel
in an efficient way.
